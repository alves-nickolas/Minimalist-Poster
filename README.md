# Minimalist Poster
By **Níckolas de Aguiar Alves**

This simple poster template is based on [Mike Morrison's #betterposter designs](https://www.youtube.com/@MikeMorrisonPhD). It is extremely minimalist and follows the basic principle: "You will read the title first, then the subtitle, then the text paragraph, and check the logos on top last." Ideally, the poster should be read in way under a minute. A QR code (automatically generated by LaTeX) links to references including further details.
