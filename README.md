This is a very simple poster template based on [Mike Morrison's #betterposter designs](https://www.youtube.com/@MikeMorrisonPhD). It is extremely minimalist and follows a basic principle of "You will read the title first, then the subtitle, then the text paragraph, and check the logos on top last." Ideally the poster should be read in way under a minute. A QR code (automatically generated by LaTeX) links to references including further details.
